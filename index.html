If that's not your thing, we have a 1 day PowerShell refresher crash course led by one of the best PowerShell trainers from the United States. This is geared up to make sure you get the most from being a conference attendee.</p>
        <p>At the end of Day 1 (Friday), we have drinks and nibbles at a local bar where you can connect with peers and the speakers in a more relaxed setting. All included in your ticket price. Remember, we still have another full day of content on Saturday though!</p>

                                <p>So you have played with PowerShell.  You may have even downloaded and modified some scripts.  How about learning more about how PowerShell actually works?  In this workshop, we will take your basic knowledge of PowerShell and clarify some confusing aspects.  You will also work through the most common mistakes made while learning PowerShell so you do not waste time. This will allow you to modify scripts faster and learn PowerShell with more confidence.  We will also show you how to justify the cost saving benefits of PowerShell to your employer and more.  

Microsoft Certified Trainer and SAPIEN Technologies PowerShell MVP Jason Yoder will guide you through these initial steps into learning. He will drive your creativity and empower your ingenuity with real world examples.

There will be a lot of code examples to download and hands on activities for those in attendance.  Bring a laptop to fully participate.

                                <p>This session is a deep dive into how we can develop and test our ‘infrastructure-as-code’ on both Windows and Linux platforms using PowerShell DSC as well as open-source and cross-platform tooling from Chef. Over 25% of all compute resource running in Azure is now running Linux and many applications comprise both Linux and Windows Servers. I’ll show how Azure is an ideal place to inexpensively perform cross-platform verification testing by using Test Kitchen and Chef’s latest testing and compliance framework, InSpec.</p>

                               <p>Beginning in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can install multiple versions of the same module on the same computer; even in the same directory. Open source and PowerShellGet have revolutionized the availability of modules and Windows PowerShell 5.0+ will be continuously updated with Windows. The result is a myriad of interlocking parts with far more potential for conflicts in name, version, and functionality. When you run a command, how do you guarantee that you're running the command that you intend, instead of a command with the same name in a different module or a different version of the same module? How do you manage conflicting requirements for versions of PowerShell and versions of modules? Are we fated for the old "DLL Hell?" In this talk, I'll present the problem, describe some mitigating strategies, warn about their limitations, and provide a roadmap for version sanity.</p>

                               <p>Containers are the new and popular binaries for deployment. The frenzy is huge and almost everybody is moving to container based deployment. Microsoft has also adopted Docker containers as first class citizen within its Windows Server 2016. Container based on Windows images can be managed by Desired State Configuration. In this demo heavy session, we will deploy an application on Docker container. After deploying we will go through the steps to manage both the environment and application configuration through Desired State Configuration.  </p>

                               <p>"Back in the days of PowerShell v1 & v2 there were very few PowerShell IDE's that really helped us in developing out PowerShell Scripts. Now with PowerShell v5 there is a much larger and more mature level of choices for the IDE. In this session we will look at the benefits of the following IDE's PowerShell ISE, PowerShell ISE + ISE Steroids, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, Visual Studio Code + PowerShell Extension, Visual Studio + PowerShell Tools and if your still using it Notepad ++. This Session will leave you in a better place to understand which IDE will be the best fit for you."</p>

                               <p>Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration requires a release pipeline. We increase our reliability of changes by automating through a pipeline. Most people with an interest in CI/CD and DevOps are aware of what this is but not really how to implement it. Last year, Microsoft released a whitepaper called "The Release Pipeline" which helped IT professionals understand what a Release Pipeline is but not really how to do it.
                                   In his day job, Matt has been working with a Customer to make the Release Pipeline a reality. This Engineering team at a major financial company have begun the journey from GUI operators to managing their platform "as-code".
                                   In this session we will talk about how we are doing this, how we approached the change culturally and technologically. We will share where we are currently at, the challenges we faced and enable you to benefit from our learnings as we begin transitioning to a DevOps culture.</p>

                               <p>Package Management has started getting a lot of momentum with the release of WMF 5.0. It has now reached a level of maturity that enterprises have started adopting it. Linux world always had very rich package management tools and windows was missing their equivalent. With the release of WMF 5.0, Windows get Package Management as first class citizen for managing deployments on Windows operating system. In this demo heavy session, we will look into the various concepts that enables Package Management. We will deep dive into Package sources, repository, Nuget, chocolatey, finding and installing packages, upgrading and uninstalling packages and how the overall pieces comes together to provide a complete package management solution to administrators. Nano Servers provides extensions to package management and has its own set of commands for its management. Container also provides its own image management. We will look into all these activities through demos.</p>

                               <p>DSC is a brilliant tool to implement installation and configuration of features within Microsoft operating systems, but maintaining or changing these configurations is often difficult. Puppet Enterprise and DSC provide the platform to do this in a repeatable and consistent manner that provides a configuration management in a manner that is secure, repeatable and auditable.</p>

                               <p>PowerShell is extremely forgiving and extensible, but these niceties come at a cost. We’ll explore these, and different strategies for boosting execution speed (and limiting memory footprint), by looking at algorithmic refactoring, types and language constructs to avoid, runspace management, and low-level API’s.</p>

                               <p class="speaker"><strong>June Blender</strong><br /></p> 
                               <p>Comment-based help is a good start, but professional modules, including open-source projects and modules in PowerShell Gallery, require more professional help. In this talk, we'll cover the basic and advanced features of comment-based help and XML help, including naming and locating files, supporting online help and updatable help, supporting help in multiple languages, and common errors that can break help in different versions of PowerShell. Then, we'll focus on the most important -- and most frequently skipped -- element of module help: the About topic that makes your module stand out from the rest.</p>

                               <p>"DBAs looking after large estates will have a number of default scripts that they wish to run across their estate. Whether it is fantastic community scripts such as Ola Hallengrens Maintenance Solution and Brent Ozars sp_Blitz or company specific security audit solutions or just your favourite Extended Event Sessions, keeping track of these and updating them can be time-comsuming and troublesome. In this session I will show you how I achieve this using my DBA Database and Powershell"</p>

This may cost 10 seconds of time or it may take several hours but it will definitely stop the current task and impact its completion. A SQL DBA will be required to provide a myriad of information in many different ways to many different types of people, answering questions from technical teams, technology teams, other parts of the business as well as directors and external parties.  In this session you will learn the why, what and how of automating the gathering, storing and displaying of information enabling self-service and reducing the interruptive calls on your time whilst ensuring that the data is correct and trustworthy. I will also show you how you can use this to enable consistency across your estate.
